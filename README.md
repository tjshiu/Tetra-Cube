# Tetra-Cube


[Live Demo](https://tjshiu.github.io/Tetra-Cube/)

Tetra-Cube is an interactive game. It's inspired by the classic Tetras game that many have played. It uses javascript, CSS, HTML5 and HTML canvas.
This project was built in a week. I do plan on continuing with the project and making improvements over time.

## Project Design
Tetris battle was designed to be played against others. The focus is to be bug free and user friendly.

## Technologies

Due to the short time, the game was designed to be simple. The chosen technologies (Heroku, Javascript, HTML5 Canvas) was chosen to be adequate for the amount of time.

Canvas was used for smooth transition and functions such as using `requestAnimationFrame()` was used instead of setInterval or setTimeout due to its efficiency.

## Possible Future Features
* Add multiplayer functionality
* Add items that will cause damages to opponents
* Add an about for points and to see what tools to use to play the game
